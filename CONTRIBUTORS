# This is the official list of people who can contribute (and typically have
# contributed) code to the Bolo repository.  The AUTHORS file lists the
# copyright holders; this file lists people.  For example, if an organization
# holds copyright on submissions, its employees would be listed in this file,
# not in AUTHORS.
#
# The submission process automatically checks to make sure that people
# submitting code are listed in this file (by email address).
#
# Names should be added to this file only after verifying that the individual
# or the individual's organization has agreed to the appropriate Contributor
# License Agreement, found here:
#
#     https://github.com/bolo/bolo/blob/master/docs/legal/icla.txt
#     https://github.com/bolo/bolo/blob/master/docs/legal/ccla.txt
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file, either J's name or
# J's organization's name should be added to the AUTHORS file, depending on
# whether the individual or corporate CLA was used.

# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Individual's name <submission email address>
#     Individual's name <submission email address> <email2> <emailN>
#
# Multiple email addresses may be specified if commits are submitted under
# different email addresses for the same individual.  The first listed email
# address will be used for contact, should the need arise.

# Please keep the list sorted.
